  <h1>Next.js API Boilerplate</h1>
</div>

This boilerplate repository is a great starting point for building APIs (no UI) with Next.js.

## Features

* Built-in middleware handler
* Built-in HTTP status code library
* Simple wrapper function for creating new API endpoints
* Support for async middleware
* No need to use `/api` in your paths

## Getting started

To get started with this boilerplate, click the ["Use this template"](https://github.com/trezy/next-api-boilerplate/generate) button on Github to create a new repository! From there, you can delete all of the example endpoints and start creating your own! üòÅ

### Running your API for local development

To run your API for local development, you can use the `start` script to kick off the local server:

```bash
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

Now that you're up‚Äìand‚Äìrunning, make sure to check out our guide to [creating your first endpoint](docs/creating-your-first-endpoint.md)!
